<h1>Baking</h1>
<p>Baking is the process of cooking food using dry heat in an enclosed space, typically an oven, to transform doughs and batters into finished products like bread, cakes, and pastries. It is one of the oldest cooking methods and relies on a combination of ingredients such as <b>flour, eggs, sugar, and leavening agents,</b> with heat being transferred through <i>conduction, convection, and radiation.</i> Beyond cooking, baking is also a hobby that involves <u>creativity, customization, and sensory enjoyment.</u></p>

<p style="text-align:centre;font-size:20px;">In addition to bread, baking is used to prepare cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, quiches, cookies, scones, crackers, pretzels, and more. These popular items are known collectively as "baked goods," and are often sold at a bakery, which is a store that carries only baked goods, or at markets, grocery stores, farmers markets or through other venues.</p>
